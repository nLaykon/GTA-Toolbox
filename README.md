# GTAToolbox
Just a simple python program which can help you with various things / exploits. All features in this "Menu" are external, the only time I interact with the game is to suspend the process. I made this for myself but one of my friends convinced me to release it.

## Features
```
Solo public session
No-Save
```

## Explanation
Most things can be changed in the config. Any major release may break your config.

## Usage
### Config
The config is very self explanatory so don't be afraid to mess around with it, if you somehow manage to break it you can just delete it and it will regenerate.

### Solo public session
Just load into a standard public session and click your keybind for "Suspend Kick"
### No-Save
I'll add more in-depth guides to this at a later point but for now please refer to this Reddit post: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaglitches/comments/okz5lg/exploit_pc_v1_nosavingsaveblock_method_ahk_replay/)

## Final notes
If you have any other external "exploits" feel free to make an issue and I'll look into adding it

### Buy me a coffee
Don't feel obligated but know I very much appreciate this <3
